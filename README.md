# Draft README

yeye I know everyone have done algorithm visulizers but i figured i might be a fun thing to do. 
Right now the plans are to create a visual representation for the most popular sorting and searching algorithms.

Implemented and working:
  -Insertion sort (needs optimization)

Almost done:
  - Quick Sort
  - Bubble Sort

Plans:
  - Binary search
  - Bogosort :)
  - Maybe some cool algorithms on weird and funny data structures.
